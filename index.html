        <h3>Welcome to Purview.</h3>

<p>Unfortunately the GUI can't currently be built because of a dependency (qt-jambi). 
There is a new version of purview at <a href="https://github.com/Purview/purview">the Purview organisation on github</a> which is written in Haskell and fully up-to-date. However, it lacks some of the analysers we implemented in this version. I'm still working on porting everything over to that version whenever I have time.
Meanwhile, why not read the code for educational purposes or try to use it with your own code under the terms of the Apache license. You could also try to build the web-ui branch (which should work), but keep in mind not everything is fully up to date with the final version of the analysers in there.</p>

<p>Remember that Scala and other dependencies used in this project are generally extremely out-of-date, and this project isn't actively maintained anymore.</p>
